# AR Workspace Builder

This app is built for HoloLens 2 and is a simulator of an industrial workspace.

The user can select a number of objects from different sets. Within each, the user finds a menu to select the object they would like to view. When you tap on the selected object, it appears and you can drag and rotate it as you like. This app has the function of saving and loading the position of objects via a script activated by buttons in the scene.
