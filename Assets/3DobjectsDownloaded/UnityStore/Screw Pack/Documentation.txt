DOCUMENTATION


This package contains a collection of 14 detailed screw heads and a washer with 5 different materials (rust, black metal, titanium, copper and aluminium). The model sizes are 10 cm, 5 cm and 2.5 cm. The asset supports Builtin RP, URP and HDRP. 
The asset also contains a set of icons if you want to use the models with the Surforge asset. In the Surforge manual you can find a description how to do that under "Creating custom Surforge assets -> Creating Add Detail tool assets".

Please note:

When importing the asset to your project you only need to import the desired render pipeline folder (Builtin RP, URP, HDRP) and the General folder + Demo and Post Processing if you want.
If you switch between Builtin RP demo, URP demo and HDRP demo don‘t forget to remove or add the RenderPipelineAsset in Project Settings -> Graphics -> Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings. If you want to use the URP or HDRP demo don't forget to install URP or HDRP from the package manager.

You can find the RenderPipelineAsset in URP/RenderPipeline/UniversalRenderPipelineAsset
